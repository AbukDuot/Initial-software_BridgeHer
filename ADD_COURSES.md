# Add Technology and Finance Courses

## Option 1: Using SQL (Fastest)

Run the SQL script directly in your database:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d bridgeherdb -f backend/seed-courses.sql
```

Or manually in pgAdmin/psql:

```sql
-- Technology Course
INSERT INTO courses (title, description, category, level, duration, mentor, downloadable)
VALUES (
  'Introduction to Technology',
  'Learn fundamental technology skills including computer basics, internet usage, and digital tools for modern work.',
  'Technology',
  'Beginner',
  '6 weeks',
  'Tech Expert',
  true
);

-- Finance Course
INSERT INTO courses (title, description, category, level, duration, mentor, downloadable)
VALUES (
  'Financial Literacy for Women',
  'Master personal finance, budgeting, saving strategies, and financial planning to achieve economic independence.',
  'Finance',
  'Beginner',
  '8 weeks',
  'Finance Advisor',
  true
);
```
